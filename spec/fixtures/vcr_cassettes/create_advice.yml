        are more flexible:\n   - Reduce Gym Membership cost to $30\n   - Reduce Dining
        Out cost to $150\n\nRevised budget breakdown based on the 50/30/20 rule:\n-
        Needs (50%): $1800\n- Wants (30%): $750\n- Savings (20%): $750\n\nNew breakdown:\n-
        Rent: $1500\n- Utilities: $300\n- Gym Membership: $30\n- Dining Out: $150\n-
        Emergency Fund: $500\n- Retirement: $250\n\nThis revised budget allocation
        aligns more closely with the 50/30/20 rule, ensuring a balanced approach to
        spending, saving, and financial security."}'
