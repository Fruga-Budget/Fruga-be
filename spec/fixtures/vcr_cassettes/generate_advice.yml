      string: '{"advice":"The user''s current budget breakdown does not match the
        50/30/20 rule. Here are specific recommendations for adjustments:\n\n1. **Rent:**
        Not negotiable. This should ideally be 50% of income, but it''s already at
        40%.\n\n2. **Utilities:** Negotiable. Consider reducing usage to lower cost.\n\n3.
        **Groceries:** Negotiable. Look for cheaper alternatives or discounts.\n\n4.
        **Dining Out:** Consider reducing to $250 to align with 30%.\n\n5. **Entertainment:**
        Consider reducing to $500 to align with 20%.\n\n6. **401k:** Already at 4%,
        aligning with 20%.\n\n7. **Savings Account:** Consider increasing to $300
        to align with 30%.\n\nRevised Budget Breakdown:\n- Rent: $2,000 (40%)\n- Utilities:
        $400 (8%)\n- Groceries: $400 (8%)\n- Dining Out: $250 (5%)\n- Entertainment:
        $500 (10%)\n- 401k: $200 (4%)\n- Savings Account: $300 (6%)\n\nThis breakdown
        closely aligns with the 50/30/20 rule."}'
