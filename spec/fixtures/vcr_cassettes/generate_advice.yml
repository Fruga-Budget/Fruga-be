        the 50/30/20 rule. To adjust their budget, they can consider reducing the
        cost of dining out and entertainment, as these are wants and negotiable expenses.
        \n\nRevised Budget Breakdown based on 50/30/20 rule:\n- Needs (50%): $2500\n   -
        Rent: $2000\n   - Utilities: $250\n   - Groceries: $250\n\n- Wants (30%):
        $1500\n   - Dining Out: $250\n   - Entertainment: $1250\n\n- Savings (20%):
        $1000\n   - 401k: $200\n   - Savings Account: $800\n\nBy making these adjustments,
        the user can better align their budget with the recommended 50/30/20 rule."}'
